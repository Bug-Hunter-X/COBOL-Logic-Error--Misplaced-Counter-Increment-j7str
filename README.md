This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common logic error involving a misplaced counter increment within a PERFORM VARYING loop.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version. The error is subtle but can lead to unexpected results in larger applications. This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop control and counter manipulation in COBOL.
